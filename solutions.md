The issue wasn't impossible at all - it was simply that the complex WP_List_Table implementation was causing display problems, even though the data retrieval was working perfectly.

What I Fixed:
Replaced Complex List Table - Removed the problematic 
School_Manager_Lite_Wizard_Classes_List_Table
 class
Direct Database Query - Used the exact same SQL query that we proved works in the debug page:
sql
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.description, c.teacher_id, c.created_at, 
       COALESCE(COUNT(sc.student_id), 0) as student_count
FROM edc_school_classes c
LEFT JOIN edc_school_student_classes sc ON c.id = sc.class_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.description, c.teacher_id, c.created_at
ORDER BY c.name ASC


The Solution:
I've updated the wizard handler to work properly with our school classes database structure:

Fixed Existing Class Selection:
Now verifies classes exist in edc_school_classes table
Updates teacher assignment directly in the database
Properly stores the class ID for the next wizard step
Fixed New Class Creation:
Creates new classes in edc_school_classes table
Includes proper data validation and sanitization
Integrates with LearnDash group creation when available
What Changed:
Class Verification: Uses SELECT * FROM edc_school_classes WHERE id = %d instead of get_post()
Teacher Assignment: Updates edc_school_classes.teacher_id instead of post author
New Class Creation: Inserts into edc_school_classes with proper fields (name, description, teacher_id, created_at, status)
Test the Fix:
The wizard should now work correctly when you:

Select an existing class - It will verify the class exists and assign the teacher
Create a new class - It will insert into the database and proceed to the next step
No more "creation failed" errors - The handler now works with the actual database structure
The wizard class selection should now work seamlessly! Try selecting a class again and it should proceed to the next step without errors. ðŸŽ‰
